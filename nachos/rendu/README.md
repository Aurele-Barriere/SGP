The best way to execute these tests is to open two terminals, execute `./nachos -f nachos_x_recv.cfg` then in the other terminal `./nachos -f nachos_x_send.cfg`.

The configuration files infixed with a `2` use the programs that expect or send two messages. The files infixed with a `inter` use interruptions, the ones with a `busy` use busy waiting.
